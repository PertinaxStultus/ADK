    - What are the potential upper and lower limits for the balance factor (BF)?
    in our observation of the previus code we came to the conclution that the lower 
    lower limit of the balance factor is 0 and the potential higher limit i 6

    -What order of numbers in would result in the highest possible BF ?
    in our observation we came to the conclution that almost or entirely sorted lists have the highrst BF

    -What order of numbers in would result in the lowest possible BF ?
    we came to the conclution that the more unsorted an array is the lower BF it BST will have

    -When a BST can be considered as balanced and when considered as imbalanced,based on the possible values of BF for any n?
    in our disscusion we came to the conclution that a BST with the BF value grater then 3 is considered unbalanced and
    a balanced BST has the BF value less then 3
