Disclosure:
To perform this exercise WE have utilized external resources and assistance
-LLM- based Chatbot[ChatGPT]

-Literature ["Skansholm, Jan(2016) C från början" "Cormen, Thomas H., Leiserson, Charles E., Rivest, Ronald L. and Stein, Clifford (senaste upplagan)

In this exercise we were asked to use the algorithms in A2_Ex1 on two different arrays, our solution to this was to just copy in the functions from A2_Ex1 in to this exercise and add the two arrays in the main function, then later call the function and sort the arrays with them.


- The code is implemented in the following files
- Exercise3.c


- Code Execution
The code was compiled and run in the visual studio code IDE.
- open visual studio code
- open the unzipped file in vs code
- if not already download the extension “code runner” and “C/C++”
- when/if the extensions is downloaded just right click on the coding space and press “run code”

Test cases:

Case1:
In this case we ran used all three different function in the given array:
A[] = {3,1,5,10,8,7,5,2,9,6,1,2};

And we got the following results:
Insertion:  1122355678910
Merge:	 1122355678910
quick-sort: 1122355678910

Case2: 

In this case we were asked to sort our “pertion number” with the last four digits randomized  with the three different algorithms, so in my case i sorted the following array:
ID[] = {2,0,0,4,0,9,2,1,6,9,6,9};
The we named our array “ID” and by using the algorithms in Ex1 i got the following results:
insertion: 000122466999
merge: 000122466999
quickSort: 000122466999
